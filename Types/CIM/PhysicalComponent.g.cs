A physical package can be hot-swapped if the element can be replaced by a physically different (but equivalent) one while the containing package is turned on. For example, a fan component may be designed to be hot-swapped. All components that can be hot-swapped are inherently removable and replaceable.

A package is considered removable even if the power must be off to perform the removal. If the power can be on and the package removed, then the element is removable and can be hot-swapped. For example, an upgradeable processor chip is removable.

For example, some computer systems allow the main processor chip to be upgraded to one of a higher clock rating. In this case, the processor is said to be replaceable.
